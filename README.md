# StayHealthy - Medical Appointment Booking Website

## 📋 Project Overview

StayHealthy Inc. is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving healthcare facilities in remote areas with minimal to no medical facilities or resources. As part of the **Go Digital** initiative, this website helps patients access doctors anytime, anywhere.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

StayHealthy conducted an extensive survey and found that patients in remote areas face significant challenges:

- **Limited Access**: No doctors or hospitals within a 50-mile radius
- **Long Wait Times**: Extended delays to meet a doctor
- **Critical Consequences**: Life-threatening emergencies or lost lives due to delayed care

With increasing internet and broadband availability in remote areas, this platform aims to connect patients with general physicians and specialists at the right time.
